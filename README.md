# Captcha-Form

Generate a random string of characters or numbers to be utilized as a captcha. This can be achieved by producing a random number and converting it to a string through the use of the toString() method, or by creating an array of characters and selecting random characters from it with the Math.random() method.

Display the captcha on the sign-up form by creating an HTML element like a <div> or <span>, and setting the innerHTML property to the randomly generated captcha string.

Include an input field for the user to enter the captcha text. You can use the <input> element and set its type attribute to text.

Upon form submission, verify the user's input against the generated captcha string. You can compare the input text to the generated captcha string with an if statement.

If the entered text matches the generated captcha string, permit the form submission. If not, exhibit an error message and prohibit the form submission.
